# Leaf-Classification-using-leaves-recognition
Plants could be classified based on their leaves. The idea is to find the feature extraction methods that can help to characterize the textures, shapes, edges, and geometrical or structural properties of the leaves, and use appropriate classification methods to categorize leaves that correspond to different plants.

To run this program first you have to

Steps:

2. Extract the zip file in the same folder where dataset has been extracted.
3. Run the LeafClassification.ipynb on Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run every cell in a sequence on Jupyter Notebook.
